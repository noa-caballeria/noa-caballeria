- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @noa-caballeria
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Skateboard, Chemical Physics, Martial-Arts, Music, Reading, Video Games
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning in a Programming School named La Plateforme in France at Marseille
- ðŸŒ  I don't have any dream to be honest except for maybe being able to work at Bungie
- ðŸ‘… I speak French of course, and I have a really good level in English that I improve everyday to be able someday to speak naturally
- ðŸ“« How to reach me : noa.caballeria@laplateforme.io

In my Git Hub you will see some works that I have done during my programmations lessons.
Some of them have some problem because I've just started, and I'm looking to improve them in the future to improve my skills and continuing to learn.
I have some projects that maybe I will upload here that are extras, and mostly for enjoying.
